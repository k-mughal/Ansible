## Inventory & Ping Module
> We have a control machine running the Ubuntu operating system Next, we have three machines: web01, web02, and DB01, all of them running CentOS 9. Our first task is to establish a connection between the control machine and its target machines. From here on, I'll refer to these EC2 instances as target machines. When I mention 'targets,' I'm specifically talking about host-web01, host-web02, and host-DB01. The control machine needs to connect to these target machines, and we know that Ansible uses SSH to connect to them. To SSH into these EC2 instances, we use the command 'ssh -i [key path] [username]@[IP address]. We need to provide the same information to Ansible so that it can SSH into the target machines
